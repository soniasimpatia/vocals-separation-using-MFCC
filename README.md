# vocals-separation-using-MFCC
Colledge project that uses MFCC coefficients to separate vocals on voiced/voiceless 

# Introduction

Simpler colledge project that uses MFCC coefficients and K-Means machine learning algorithm to classify vocals on voced/voiceless.

# Requirements

In time of making this project the following is needed:
- Python v.3
- Librosa libray
- Pandas library
- Sklearn library
- Jupyter-notebook v 7.2.0

# Need to mention...

Project works on smaller audio files that can calculate less than 128 MFCC coefficients. It needs more work for excluding MFCC coefficients that are out of order than usuall data. Wav and lab files are provided from University of Rijeka, Technical faculty.
